Description: Lets you open a fixed-width ASCII file (.txt or
    .dat) that has an accompanying setup file (.sps or .sas). These file
    combinations are sometimes referred to as .txt+.sps, .txt+.sas,
    .dat+.sps, or .dat+.sas. This will only run in a txt-sps or txt-sas
    pair in which the setup file contains instructions to open that text
    file. It will NOT open other text files, .sav, .sas, or .por data
    files.  Fixed-width ASCII files with setup files are common in older
    (pre-2000) government data.
